Release Notes
=============

This document covers release specific notes. Here I'll try to document each 
release and the changes that were introduced.

Always remember: the only real authority for change is the code.

Future
------

Some of the todo's are littered throughout the app in source. Just
search for TODO.

Here I'll list some future todo's that I plan on working on. In the future this
may move to a proper tracker.

* Some FSM's should be servers, or pools: not bound to one inbound
  connection. This especially applies to UDP connections. I'm not sure
  of the cost of starting processes but it feel more 'right' to have
  a pool of workers ready to act that aren't bound to a single requester
  process. Examples are:
   - organic.logger.syslog_3164.decode_fsm
   - organic.logger.route.route_fsm.erl
  I think process groups (using pg2) is the way to go, using a supervisor
  to restart broken processes and keeping a constant number of pooled 
  processes. Of course, how does this pool scale under different load one asks ...

* Structure based on how extensible bits will be written: For now I'm creating a
  supervisor for each component regardless of its architectural responsibility. 
  In the future we may want to split things into: in, processing and out. Think:
  what bits are pluggable and what is the easiest way to modularise. We also need
  to be mindful of potentially running different process types on different boxes.

* Support for other syslog protocols other then just RELP. The Syslog Protocol 
  (latest): http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc5424 seems to be the latest one and 
  supports TCP. This is going to give us the most coverage I believe. There is a
  UDP variant available but I don't think this is quite as useful due to lower
  reliability.

* Produce an agent to run on a box for aggregation and local access. This agent
  should probably communicate back to the central server using something
  asynchronous like STOMP/AMQP. The agent itself should provide the means for 
  other systems such as Nagios, Collectd etc. to send messages back to the 
  central server. Investigate technologies like ZeroMq, RabbitMq and ActiveMq.

* Investigate using Lucene as a storage end-point.

* Utilising the lucene storage, provide a web front end for searching and 
  reporting on this data. Our friend whack on #devops is looking at elasticsearch
  for logstash for example.

* Implement rules engine as set out in rule-definitions.txt, allow these rules
  to be managed via a web GUI.

Version 1 - not yet released
---------

Here is a rough list of the current features for this release.

* Added ologctl for start/stop operations
* Made RELP receiver work
* Store decoded packets in mongodb
* Logging to a single file
* Created Emakefile used by emake to build Erlang specific bits
* Created Makefile for complete build purposes as emake is not holistic enough,
  and make is more familiar to the average punter
* organic.conf module and conf.hrl header provide macros and functions for 
  accessing basic global configuration. Currently this configuration is provided
  in sys.config, but may change. The abstraction from mechanism is provided for
  this in the ?CONF macro.
* Logging macros and functions. Now app logging goes to the file defined in
  'ologd_log'.
